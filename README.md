# AI Agents Framework Experiments

This repository contains my personal experiments with various AI agent frameworks, including:

- [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai) - Framework for orchestrating role-playing autonomous AI agents
- [SmolAgents](https://github.com/smol-ai/smol-agent) - Lightweight framework for building autonomous agents
- [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) - Framework for building stateful, multi-agent workflows

## Experiments

Various experiments in this repository demonstrate:

- Different agent role configurations and architectures
- Task delegation and coordination between agents
- Specialized tools and capabilities
- Performance evaluations across frameworks
- Framework-specific features and best practices

## Requirements

Experiments typically require:

- Python 3.12+
- Various agent frameworks (CrewAI, SmolAgents, LangGraph)
- LangChain
- Different LLM connections and integrations
